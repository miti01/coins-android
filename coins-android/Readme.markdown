# Coins for Android

A simple app to see how much your wallet is worth. It's like [Shares](http://getsharesapp.com) but for Bitcoin.

This is my first Android app. Donâ€™t laugh.

## License

Coins is released under the [MIT license](LICENSE). While the license says you can do whatever you want with it, I'd apprecaite it if you don't release an exact copy to the App Store. This is released as an open source project primarily for educational purposes. That said, there's nothing stopping you from doing whatever you want with it.
